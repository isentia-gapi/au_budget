2. Stakeholders,The people of Australia are advocating for change in the upcoming budget as highlighted by two social media posts. One post praises Ben Phillips' article urging the government to prioritize disadvantaged individuals in a wealthy nation. Another post criticizes the government's spending on AUKUS subs while the Welfare Report is released and the impending budget looms. These posts signal a growing dissatisfaction among Australians with the country's political leadership as they call for better governance and policies that cater to the needs of all citizens.
