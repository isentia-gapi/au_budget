1. People,"â€¢ The Australian community is rife with some heated conversations of late. Some people are calling out for the government to inject funding into repairing rural roads, while others are questioning the legacy of the Morrison government's $1 trillion plus debt. People are also discussing tax revenue, with a focus on personal income tax and bracket creep, and revenue to corporations. Some have even called for Australia to receive a direct and fair share of profits from the country's limited national resources. The conversation is real and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon."
