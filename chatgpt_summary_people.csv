1. People,Australian people voiced their opinions on social media after the recent federal budget announcement. From Huw Parkinson's BUDGET NIGHTMARES video to Jim Chalmers's response on the $74 billion saving on the NDIS scheme people discussed various topics in politics. Some criticized politicians' one-liners while others accused them of lackluster budget proposals. A social media post questioned Labor Party's support for fossil fuel projects while another post appreciated the budget's focus on creating opportunities for Australians.
