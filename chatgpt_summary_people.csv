1. People,People have much to say about the upcoming Federal Budget. Many are hopeful that the budget will include policies that tackle the rising cost of living infrastructure investment and solutions to address the housing crisis and workforce shortages. However others are frustrated by rumors of a surplus which they argue will not help those who live in poverty. The budget has been lauded for offering aged care workers the biggest pay boost ever granted to the sector yet there are concerns that youth income support has not increased at the same rate as rising rent prices.
