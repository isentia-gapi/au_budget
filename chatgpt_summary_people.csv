0,1. People,"â€¢ This was a wild ride! Taking the sizzling posts from the internet, it seems like someone's done right, someone's done wrong, and another person's got everyone thinking! We saw one person praising inflation progress and another slamming an MP for not preventing iPhone fraud. We also got to experience some drama with others calling out hypocrites and making excuses for budget mishaps. Encouragement was in the air as one user cheered on clean energy efforts and agreed with a message 1,000%! However, a post pointing out broken promises and increasing electricity costs did not have us feeling very optimistic."
