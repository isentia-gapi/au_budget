1. People,After analyzing the posts from various social media users it appears that the Government's renovations of Parliament buildings are causing concern as they will cost taxpayers over $90 million instead of the originally estimated $22 million. Furthermore there is a call for change regarding Australia's flawed gas tax system which allows multinational corporations to pay little to no tax while nurses are paying higher taxes. While some posts were too general it seems that people want the government to be held accountable and create a fair taxation system for all.
