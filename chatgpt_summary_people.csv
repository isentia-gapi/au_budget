0,1. People,"This is post #11: @yvettemcphee Shock #LNP is trying to push through laws to make it legal to arrest protesters. Do they know what country this is? Stop stealing our rights! #auspol

Sure thing! Here's the 50-word summary:

People across Australia are calling out the LNP and pushing back against the proposed legislation that allows authorities to arrest protestors. Australians enjoy the freedom to express their dissenting opinions- the government cannot take this right away. People are outraged at the LNP's moves to suppress protests and limit their rights. Will they stop, listen, and reconsider? #FreedomOfSpeech #AusPol #ProtestRights @yvettemcphee"
