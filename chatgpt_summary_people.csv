1. People,The buzz around #auspol is going haywire as people discuss the upcoming federal budget. While some are worried about the Labor budget and its ability to handle finances others are hopeful that government spending will prioritize health and allied health issues. It's not all serious talk as we see the Prime Minister cracking jokes about a surplus during a caucus speech. However social media users raised their eyebrows at questionable aspects of the budget including payments to tax havens and some dubious contractual agreements. On the upside Treasurer @JEChalmers has announced $14.6 billion of cost-of-living relief to support those finding it hard to make ends meet.
