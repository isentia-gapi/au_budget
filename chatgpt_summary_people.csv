1. People,"â€¢ People are talking up a storm on social media! With Australia's personal and company income taxes slowly increasing YoY, many are calling out the government for their alleged greed. Furthermore, calls for fixing rural roads are being made, with various agriculture organizations and businesses pleading for an urgent injection of funding to get these issues resolved. But that's not all; there are disagreements regarding tax avoidance amongst corporations, as some say the government is collecting 18% more in taxes than before. In addition, many are complaining about the amount of debt the Morrison government has incurred, leading to the question of how to deal with the legacy of the government's massive debt. Finally, some believe that as Australia only has a limited amount of natural resources, the country should receive a fair share of the profits."
