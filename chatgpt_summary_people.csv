1. People,Australian social media is buzzing with anticipation for the upcoming federal budget. People are concerned that the budget will heavily favor national security and defense at the expense of social security that is facing challenges like low wages and rising costs of living. Concerns have been raised over the government's planned crackdown on e-cigarettes and the oil and gas industry's evasion of taxes and royalties.
