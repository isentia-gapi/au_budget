1. People,Australian people are calling on their government to take action ahead of the upcoming Federal budget. People want change as they post about the cost of aged care services spiraling the need for increased welfare assistance and the pain of a 'seriously inadequate' jobseeker rate. Furthermore local projects such as Rockhampton's Ring Road and the affordable healthcare access should be included in the budget. The Australia Institute has flagged that Stage 3 tax cuts are 'fiscally irresponsible' and will cost more than $240 billion in the next 10 years. Young people facing homelessness and women looking to enter the workforce are also lobbying for support.
