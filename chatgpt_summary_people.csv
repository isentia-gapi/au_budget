1. People,The Australian Federal Budget has been a hot topic with people expressing their expectations and opinions on social media. Public opinion diverges; some are excited about infrastructural growth the reduction of the cost of living and funding for work and housing. However there's significant criticism for continuous political mismanagement budget surpluses and the government's lack of action on critical issues such as the housing crisis and workforce shortages. In any event we need to wait for the Budget presentation on Tuesday to know precisely what the Australian government has in store for us.
