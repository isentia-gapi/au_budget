1. People,As we wait for the Australian Federal Budget 2023 to be announced people are anticipating the government's plans on how to address the cost-of-living crisis and respond to the problem of sexual violence. Some believe that the Labor party's forecast of the first surplus in 15 years is due to the rising prices of iron ore coal and gas. Others raise concerns about the government's allocation of funds with criticisms directed towards specific policies and key decision-makers. Despite these differing opinions people across Australia look forward to seeing how the government will impact various communities and industries.
