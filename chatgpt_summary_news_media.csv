3. News Media,"• Hey, guys! Want to stay in the loop and know what's trending in Australia? Look no further, because we've got the lowdown on the latest news from the people! It's no secret that the Reserve Bank of Australia is keeping everyone on their toes with ten consecutive interest rate hikes. But what's even more concerning is that there might be only one more rate hike left for 2021. Oh, and did we mention the Australian economy is set to slow down more than previously thought? Yep, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is predicting some major changes that could impact Aussies. But, it's not all bad news – our beloved Australian dollar is expected to bounce back after taking some hits. And, if you're a seafood fan, you might want to keep an eye out for the government's proposed country of origin seafood labelling scheme, which restaurants are not happy about. All this news might be a lot to take in, but hang onto your hats, because things are about to get even more interesting!"
