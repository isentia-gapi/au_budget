3. News Media,A group of high-profile people from Tasmania are proposing a fresh vision for Macquarie Point hoping to convince the government to abandon the idea of building a stadium at the site. They believe that developing the area into a green mixed-use destination for locals and tourists is a better use of the land than a stadium which is not a priority for Tasmania. On the other hand the Reserve Bank of Australia is facing one of the biggest shake-ups in its history due to criticism received for raising interest rates during a cost of living crisis. The board will be split and the changes are being welcomed but experts are warning borrowers that it may not mean that the interest rate pain is over.
