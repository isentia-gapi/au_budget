People, let's get real! The Reserve Bank of Australia has been making headlines with its interest rate decisions which are leaving Aussies both hopeful and fearful. While some economists believe positive job figures could signal future rate hikes, others fear the worst is yet to come with more pain in store for mortgage holders. Amid a rollercoaster of highs and lows, mortgage holders have won some relief recently with a pause on rate hikes, though the RBA has been quick to warn that further hikes could be on the horizon. It remains to be seen what the future holds, but one thing is certain - Aussies are in for quite a ride!"
